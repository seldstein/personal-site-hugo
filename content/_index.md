Hi, Iâ€™m **Sam Feldstein** and I'm a writer. Sometimes I write fiction, sometimes essays. I'm also fond of [blogging](/blog), [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/153965751-sam-feldstein), [watching movies](https://letterboxd.com/HoogoSteeglitz/), and [taking photographs](https://www.instagram.com/seldstein/). I'm interested in writing, storytelling, Judaism, and web design. The best way to keep up with my work is to subscribe to my [newsletter](https://samfeldstein.substack.com/) or [RSS feed](/index.xml). I'm not very active on social media, but you can find me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/seldstein/), [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@samfeldstein), and [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/HoogoSteeglitz/). If you'd like to get in touch, you can email me at [samfeldstein@proton.me](mailto:samfeldstein@proton.me).

The [Notebook](https://publish.obsidian.md/sam-feldstein/) link in the menu will take you to my digital workspace, where I keep notes, project documents, and adversaria.

I also host a podcast with my dad called [Like Father Like Son Like Movies](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/like-father-like-son-like-movies/id1640110809). You can find us on Apple Podcasts or your podcatcher of choice.

I built this website with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and a custom theme. You can see the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/seldstein/personal-website).

## Things I Use

For writing fiction, I use [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview). For writing everything else, taking notes, and managing files, I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) with the [Minimal](https://minimal.guide/home) theme and the following community plugins:

- Hider
- LanguageTool Integration
- Minimal Theme Settings
- Omnivore
- Readwise Official
- Typewriter Scroll

I used to read and annotate articles with [Readwise](https://readwise.io/), but recently switched to [Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/). Omnivore is open source, feels lighter, and so far doesn't include any annoying features you can't turn off (a la the blue bar to the left of paragraphs in Readwise). I don't know yet if Omnivore supports video transcription, but if not, I'll keep using Readwise for that and also for its daily review feature. I store my notes and highlights in Obsidian using the plugins mentioned above. I track RSS feeds with [NewsBlur](https://newsblur.com/) but am considering moving them to Omnivore.

For memorizing facts, quotes, and other information, I use [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) via [Mnemosyne](https://mnemosyne-proj.org/).

For coding, I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the following extensions:

- Code Spell Checker
- Dendron Markdown Shortcuts
- Even Better TOML
- HTML Boilerplate
- HTML CSS Support
- HTTP/s and relative link checker
- Live Server
- markdownlint
- Pylance
- Python
- YAML

I built this website with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and a [custom theme](https://github.com/seldstein/personal-website).
