Hi, Iâ€™m **Sam Feldstein** and I'm a writer. Sometimes I write fiction, sometimes essays. I'm also fond of [blogging](/blog), [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/153965751-sam-feldstein), [watching movies](https://letterboxd.com/HoogoSteeglitz/), and [taking photographs](https://www.instagram.com/seldstein/). I'm interested in writing, storytelling, Judaism, and web design. The best way to keep up with my work is to subscribe to my [newsletter](https://samfeldstein.substack.com/) or [rss feed](/index.xml). I'm not very active on social media, but you can find me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/seldstein/), [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@samfeldstein), and [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/HoogoSteeglitz/). If you'd like to get in touch, you can email me at [samfeldstein@proton.me](mailto:samfeldstein@proton.me).

The [Notebook](https://publish.obsidian.md/sam-feldstein/) link in the menu will take you to my digital workspace, where I keep notes, project documents, and adversaria.

I also host a podcast with my dad called [Like Father Like Son Like Movies](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/like-father-like-son-like-movies/id1640110809). You can find us on Apple Podcasts or your podcatcher of choice.

I built this website with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and a custom theme. You can see the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/seldstein/personal-website).
