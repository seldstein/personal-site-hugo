## New post(s) alert

In case you missed them, I wrote two new posts this week: a short one about [Talmudic wisdom in *The Exorcist*](/blog/care-dammit) (the book, not the movie) and a longer one about [shock and *Lonesome Dove*](/blog/lonesome-dove) (the movie, not the book). (It's actually a miniseries but I really wanted to capitalize on that symmetry just now.)

## New publication(s) alert

This week I have the pleasure of announcing that my short story "[The Man Who Was a Boy Made of Memories](https://talestoterrify.com/episodes/619-z-j-garcia-samuel-feldstein/)" was just published on the *Tales to Terrify* podcast. The story's an oldish one, written in the spring of 2020. It wasn't the happiest time in my life, for many reasons, but the story ends on an optimistic note, which surprised me then and surprises me now.

## Website redesign

You may have noticed that I completely redesigned this website. It might not look outrageously different, especially because the fonts haven't changed and it wasn't very complex to begin with, but rest assured, you're looking at a brand-new theme built from the ground up.

I did this for two reasons. One, I'm planning to get a job as a web developer within the next few months, so I need both the practice and the portfolio entry. Two, I don't like the idea of a bunch of files I don't need sitting in my repository, which is exactly what you get when you install a theme. Not that there's anything wrong with that. It's unavoidable in any scenario where you don't have the time or the inclination to build a website from scratch, which is most scenarios. But it happens that this is my personal website, which I'm going to have forever, and as such I want it to be perfect.

Feedback on the design is always welcome. You can send it to [samfeldstein@proton.me](mailto:samfeldstein@proton.me).

## Reading

Alan Jacobs on [Israel](https://ayjay.org/Israel.html), Matthew Yglesias on why the [two-state solution](https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-two-state-solution-is-still-best) is still the best solution, Cedric Chin on [chicken sexing and perceptual learning as a path to expertise](https://commoncog.com/chicken-sexing-and-perceptual-learning-as-a-path-to-expertise/), and Seth Simons on [how SNL spends its money](https://www.humorism.xyz/how-snl-spends-its-money/).

## Tools

As you may know, my dad and I have a podcast called [Like Father Like Son Like Movies](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/like-father-like-son-like-movies/id1640110809). I only bring it up because I hate editing audio, but I found a tool this week that makes things significantly easier. It's called [Descript](https://www.descript.com/), and what it does (or one of the things it can do, I should say) is generate a transcript of your podcast, detect the dead space and filler words (*um, like*, and the like) and delete them automatically. I saved so much time using it that I think it may have *added* years to my life.

That's all for this week.
