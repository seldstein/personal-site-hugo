It's been a long time since I've found anything as engaging as I find web design. I think it has to do with instant feedback. Coding has a videogame qualitity that really appeals to the monkey in me. I push button, thing happen. It work, is satisfying. Want do more. Then there's the fact that it feels useful in a way that fiction writing never did. To be clear, I don't think web design is inherently superior to writing or anything like that. This about where I find personal satisfaction. But then it also appeals to the part of me that likes solving problems. All this is bolstered by the fact that I can see myself getting better at coding in real time. I can feel myself wrapping my mind around it in slow motion. That's a good feeling. It's been a long since I felt like I was good at anything. Not that I'm any whiz with web design. I'm just getting started. But I think I'm conscientious enough that I could get pretty good at it, and I think I'm creative enough that it'll keep being fun, because the better I get at it, the more complex websites and programs I'll be able to write, which will push me to pursue projects at the edge of my ability, which will force me to keep learning, which is what makes life interesting, which is what makes life worth living.
