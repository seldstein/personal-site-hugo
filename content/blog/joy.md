It's been a long time since I've found anything as engaging as I find web design. I think it has to do with instant feedback. Coding has a videogame qualitity that appeals to the monkey in me. I push button, thing happen. It work, is satisfying. Want do more.

And it feels useful in a way that fiction writing never did. 

What this really is is a larger post about the differences between building a tool and building a story. Because they're not the same thing. Except they are, sort of. And what it might come down to is that I can wrap my head around one and not the other. Because everytime I try to deliniate the differences, I come back around and reverse my own argument. For example, I like to think that in web design your work is cut out for you. And that's kind of true. You have specific limitations that are consistent across every project. You're working on the same screensizes, with the same languages, and yes I understand that there are more languages to be used in web design than just html css and javascript, but those fundamentals aren't going away, as far as I can tell. You can draw some parallels with writing. You're working with words, for one thing. Unless you're multilingual,  the language you're writing in is always the same. The medium changes. There's prose vs poetry vs scripts. And then there's length constraints. Short stories vs short films vs features films vs novellas vs novels and so on. And each comes with its speicifc freedoms and limiations. Each has a specific feel. You have your sandbox. What you do inside that sandbox is completely up to you.

To be clear, I don't think web design is inherently superior to writing or anything like that. This about where I find personal satisfaction. But then it also appeals to the part of me that likes solving problems. All this is bolstered by the fact that I can see myself getting better at coding in real time. I can feel myself wrapping my mind around it in slow motion. That's a good feeling. It's been a long since I felt like I was good at anything. Not that I'm any whiz with web design. I'm just getting started. But I think I'm conscientious enough that I could get pretty good at it, and I think I'm creative enough that it'll keep being fun, because the better I get at it, the more complex websites and programs I'll be able to write, which will push me to pursue projects at the edge of my ability, which will force me to keep learning, which is what makes life interesting, which is what makes life worth living.
