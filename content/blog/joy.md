And anyway, it seems that I like building websites. It feels like it's been a long time since I've found anything that involves work legitimately engaging. Fiction writing feels this way occasionally, but probably not enough to justify the amount of time trying to get a handle on that craft. Nonfiction writing, espeically informal writing like this, feels more engaging than fiction writing but less engaging than web design. I think that has to do with instant feedback. Web design, and probably many coding and programming actitivties, has a videogame qualitity that really appeals to the monkey in me. I push button, thing happen. It work. Is satisfying. And then it appeals to the problem-solving side of me too, because frequently I try to do something and things don't work, and I have to go and figure out why. It's occassionally frustrating, but mostly it's interesting, and often it's fun. All this is bolstered by the fact that I can see myself getting better at coding in real time. I can feel myself wrapping my mind around it in slow motion. That's a very good feeling. It's been a long since I felt like I was good at anything. Not that I'm any whiz with web design. I'm just getting started. But I think I'm conscientious enough that I could get pretty good at it, and I think I'm creative enough that it'll keep being fun, because the better I get at it, the more complex websites and programs I'll be able to write, which will push me to pursue projects at the edge of my ability, which will force me to keep learning, which is what makes life interesting, which is what makes life worth living. Wow. Good work, all. We got there. We found the answer.
