It's been a long time since I've found anything as engaging as I find coding. I think it has to do with instant feedback. Coding has a videogame qualitity that appeals to the monkey in me. I push button, thing happen. It work, is satisfying. Want do more. And it feels useful in a way that fiction writing never did. (Nothing against fiction writing. This is about my personal satisfaction, and where I do and don't find it.) I can make things that serve a purpose, like a website or a [file-moving tool](/posts/file-mover.md), and I get to experience the pleasure not just of building them but of using them.

And I can see myself getting better at coding in real time. That's a good feeling. And I think I'll keep getting better, which will let me write more complex programs and websites, which will force me to keep learning, which will keep life interesting.



What this really is is a larger post about the differences between building a tool and building a story. Because they're not the same thing. Except they are, sort of. And what it might come down to is that I can wrap my head around one and not the other. Because everytime I try to deliniate the differences, I come back around and reverse my own argument. For example, I like to think that in web design your work is cut out for you. And that's kind of true. You have specific limitations that are consistent across every project. You're working on the same screensizes, with the same languages, and yes I understand that there are more languages to be used in web design than just html css and javascript, but those fundamentals aren't going away, as far as I can tell. You can draw some parallels with writing. You're working with words, for one thing. Unless you're multilingual,  the language you're writing in is always the same. The medium changes. There's prose vs poetry vs scripts. And then there's length constraints. Short stories vs short films vs features films vs novellas vs novels and so on. And each comes with its speicifc freedoms and limiations. Each has a specific feel. You have your sandbox. What you do inside that sandbox is completely up to you.

It was a always a struggle for me to sit down and write for any extended period of time. For one brief period I was putting in three hours a day, which on the one hand sounds like a lot but on the other seems woefully inadequate if you profess to aspire to write for a living. The material difference between writing and coding is that when I've been wroking on a coding project, far from forcing myself to do it, I can't seem to *stop* myself from doing it. I worked on my website for hours at a time, for days on end, until it was done. And after all that, I'm itching to start another project.
