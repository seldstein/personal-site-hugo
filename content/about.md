Hi, Iâ€™m **Sam Feldstein** and I write stories. I've also been known to pen the occasional essay. Anything not published through an outlet goes on my blog. The Notebook link in the navbar will take you to my digital workspace, where I keep my project documents and other adversaria. The best way to keep up with my work is to subscribe to my newsletter. If you'd like to get in touch, you can email me at samfeldstein@proton.me.
