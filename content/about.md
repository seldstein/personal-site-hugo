Hi, I’m **Sam Feldstein** and I write stories. I mostly work in the fantasy, horror, and science fiction genres. I'm also fond of blogging, [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/153965751-sam-feldstein), [watching movies](https://letterboxd.com/HoogoSteeglitz/), and [taking photographs](https://www.instagram.com/seldstein/). I'm interested in writing, storytelling, Judaism, and web design. I built this website with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [Mainroad](https://mainroad-demo.netlify.app/) theme. The layout was inspired by [Molly White’s website](https://www.mollywhite.net/). The best way to keep up with my work is to subscribe to my [newsletter](https://samfeldstein.substack.com/) or [rss feed](/index.xml). I'm not very active on social media, but you can find me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/seldstein/), [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@samfeldstein), and [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/HoogoSteeglitz/). If you'd like to get in touch, you can email me at [samfeldstein@proton.me](mailto:samfeldstein@proton.me).
