description: About Sam Feldstein.
draft: false
---

Hi, I’m **Sam Feldstein**. I used to want to be an [author](#published-writing), but lately I'm more interested in web design. I'm fond of [blogs](#blogroll), [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/153965751-sam-feldstein), [movies](https://letterboxd.com/HoogoSteeglitz/), and [photography](https://www.instagram.com/seldstein/).

## Things I Use

I don't write fiction so much anymore, but when I did I used [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview). For distraction-free word-dumping, I use [Enso](https://enso.sonnet.io/). For writing everything else, taking notes, and managing files, I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) with the [Minimal](https://minimal.guide/home) theme and the following community plugins:

- Hider
- LanguageTool Integration
- Minimal Theme Settings
- Omnivore
- Readwise Official
- Typewriter Mode

My go-to dictionaries are:

- [Dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/)
- [The Free Dictionary](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/)
- [*Merriam-Webster*](https://www.merriam-webster.com/)
- *The New Oxford American Dictionary* (macOS)
- *The Oxford Dictionary of English* (British English, macOS)
- [*Webster's 1913 Dictionary*](https://github.com/cmod/websters-1913) (macOS)
- *Roget’s Thesaurus*
- [Thesaurus.com](https://www.thesaurus.com/)
- [Online Etymology Dictionary](https://www.etymonline.com/)

I track RSS feeds with [NewsBlur](https://newsblur.com/). I used to read and annotate articles with [Readwise](https://readwise.io/), but recently switched to [Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/). Omnivore is open source, feels lighter, and so far doesn't include any annoying features you can't turn off (a la the blue bar to the left of paragraphs in Readwise). It doesn't support video transcription, so I'll keep using Readwise for that and also for its daily review feature. I store my notes and highlights in Obsidian using the plugins mentioned above.

For memorizing facts, quotes, and other information, I use [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) via [Mnemosyne](https://mnemosyne-proj.org/).

For coding, I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

I built this website with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and a [custom theme](https://github.com/seldstein/personal-website).
