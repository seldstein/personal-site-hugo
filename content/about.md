Hi, Iâ€™m **Sam Feldstein** and I write stories. I'm fond of blogs, books, movies, and photography. I'm interested in writing, storytelling, web design, and economics. I'm an expert in precisely nothing. The best way to keep up with my work is to subscribe to my [newsletter](https://samfeldstein.substack.com/) or [rss feed](/index.xml). If you'd like to get in touch, you can email me at [samfeldstein@proton.me](mailto:samfeldstein@proton.me). You can also find me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/seldstein/) and [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/HoogoSteeglitz/).
