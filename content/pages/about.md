Hi, I’m **Sam Feldstein** and I write stories. I mostly work in the fantasy, horror, and science fiction genres. I'm also fond of blogging, [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/153965751-sam-feldstein), [watching movies](https://letterboxd.com/HoogoSteeglitz/), and [taking photographs](https://www.instagram.com/seldstein/). I'm interested in writing, storytelling, Judaism, and web design. The best way to keep up with my work is to subscribe to my [newsletter](https://samfeldstein.substack.com/) or [rss feed](/index.xml). I'm not very active on social media, but you can find me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/seldstein/), [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@samfeldstein), and [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/HoogoSteeglitz/). If you'd like to get in touch, you can email me at [samfeldstein@proton.me](mailto:samfeldstein@proton.me).

The [Notebook]((https://publish.obsidian.md/sam-feldstein/)) link in the menu will take you to my digital workspace, where I keep notes, project documents, and other adversaria. Probably it's redundant. I had the notebook before I had this website. I think the advantage of it is having a place for thoughts are disorganzied and unpolished. I'm not behold to propriety or etiquette over there. I'd like to move the more useful items from over there to over here.

### Like Father Like Son Like Movies

A podcast I host with my dad. As you can probably tell, it's about movies. You can find us on [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/like-father-like-son-like-movies/id1640110809) or your podcatcher of choice.

I built this website with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [Mainroad](https://mainroad-demo.netlify.app/) theme. The layout was inspired by [Molly White’s website](https://www.mollywhite.net/).
