This document is inspired, formally speaking, by *[Jewish Wisdom](https://bookshop.org/p/books/jewish-wisdom-ethical-spiritual-and-historical-lessons-from-the-great-works-and-thinkers-joseph-telushkin/10301330)*. It's a work in progress.

## The two phases of writing

When you're writing, you're either generating material or shaping material.

These processes are intertwined, or they can be. When you're in shaping mode, your subsconscious might still be in generating mode. And so you get ideas as your shaping the ideas you already have. So it's not that only one of these processes can happen at a time. But they are distinct processes.

When you're generating, that's the messy time. That's the time to be completely uninhibited and just write down whatever comes to mind with no thought to whether it makes any sense, or whether you like it, or whether it fits with the story, or whether you'll even use it. 

And you continue to switch between these modes as you write. You have some ideas, and you jot them down, and then you start to shape them into a story, and then as you engage in the shaping process your brain in the background is still generating. So new ideas come to you, and you catch them as they fall, get them down, and keep going. And that's spontaneity. That's origiality. Because you didn't try to plan anything. You just took what came to you. But just because you respect the generation process doesn't mean you get to ignore the shaping process. You need both. If you only generate, your story will be a mess. It won't be a story. It'll be a pile of ideas thrown in a heap. And if you only shape, nothing you write will feel fresh.

Writing is codified spontaneity. You have to relax and allow yourself the freedom to surprise yourself, but then you have to record it, shape it, and codify it. 

> *When Chris Mannix shows up and says he's the sheriff, is he or is he not? Well I don't know yet. I only what John Ruth knows about him. I only know what Major Warren knows about him. And even when they arrive at Minnie's haberdashery and there's four other people there, I didn't know who those four other people were. I let them reveal themselves to me. By the time we did the movie I had to know who all those characters really were and where they came from in order for me to talk to the actors about it, but in the first draft I didn't want to know any more than a viewer or one of the other characters would know.*

> *It doesn't do me much good to think too much past the middle. I mean, I write genre pieces, so you have an idea of what the third act's going to be. In* Kill Bill, *I guess she'll probably kill Bill at the end. So you have an idea of how you might want it to end, and you can kind of work out what's going to get you to the middle, but to think beyond that is kind of silly, because by the time you get to the middle it's a different story, because you know things about the characters that you could never have known before you started writing.

> *A good majority of movies that come out, you pretty much know everything you're going to see in the movie by the first ten or twenty minutes. That's not a story. A story is something that constantly unfolds.*

## Writing as performance

> *What I'm about is playing the audience. I'm an orchestra conductor, and the audience is my orchestra, and the sounds they make and the feelings they have are my instruments."
> 
> [Quentin Tarantino](https://youtu.be/sXSh3p6THv0?si=wos3VGXmzVBzulqp)

Performance is about evocation. If I do *this,* the audience reacts like *that.* So it is with writing. All writers are performers, and the page is our stage.

### The audience

People say to write for yourself. That's good advice if what they mean is, "Write the story you want to write, not the story someone else wants you to write."

But sometimes what people mean is, "Fuck the audience." That's bad advice. Don't fuck the audience. You're a performer, remember? Do you mean to perform to an empty room? A falling tree makes no sound if no one hears it, and a story has no meaning if no one reads it. The audience is the point, and the fun lies in getting a reaction from them.

Still, you can't please everybody, so don't try. Instead, write for just one person. It doesn't even have to be a real person. But whoever it is, that's your muse.

Your muse may change depending on the medium. If I'm writing prose, my muse is an imagined "ideal reader" who responds to each beat exactly the way I want them to. If I'm writing a screenplay it's much the same, except the "ideal reader" becomes an "ideal audience." If I'm writing a D&D adventure, the players are my muses.

## Choosing an idea

> *Before I settle in on what I'm gonna do I'm contemplating a lot of different things. I explore some different ideas and see what stage they're at. It's almost a metaphor for falling in love. You date a lot of people and you flirt with a lot of people, but then you meet the right one. And once I realize, "Okay, this has grabbed me," now maybe I'm thinking about music choices for it maybe it gets me to actually start writing a little bit and pretty shortly into that process I'll probably end up writing something that's like, "Okay, I'm doing this."*

## Characters

To build a story, you have to understand people. The good news is that you're a people too, and you know what makes you tick.

> *How do you put the audience into a character? Easy. Show one. You'd have to go out of your way to keep the audience from imprinting on them. It could be a raccoon, a homeless man or the President. Just fade in on them and we are them until we have a better choice.*
>
> *If there are choices, the audience picks someone they can relate to. When in doubt, they follow their pity. Fade in on a raccoon being chased by a bear, we are the raccoon. Fade in on a room full of ambassadors. The President walks in and trips on the carpet. We are the President.*
> 
> Dan Harmon, [Story Structure 104: The Juicy Details](https://channel101.fandom.com/wiki/Story_Structure_104:_The_Juicy_Details)

When we see a character going through it, our heart goes out to them. That's empathy.

## Rules

### Don't bore them

A story must be entertaining before it can be anything else. A great idea is worthless if the reader can't be bothered to turn the page. If there's a first rule of writing, it's "Don't bore them."

How do we not bore them? Step one is to cut the boring parts.

> *Think of what you skip reading a novel: thick paragraphs of prose you can see have too many words in them. What the writer is doing, he’s writing, perpetrating hooptedoodle, perhaps taking another shot at the weather, or has gone into the character’s head, and the reader either knows what the guy’s thinking or doesn’t care. I’ll bet you don’t skip dialogue.*
> 
> Elmore Leonard, *[Elmore Leonard's 10 Rules of Writing](https://bookshop.org/p/books/elmore-leonard-s-10-rules-of-writing-elmore-leonard/8955676?ean=9780061451461)*

Leonard's advice applies on the macro and micro levels. A story benefits from the removal of extraneous scenes, a sentence benefits from the removal of extraneous words. In the immortal words of William Zinsser:

> *Good writing improves in direct proportion to the number of things that are kept out of it that shouldn't be there.*
> 
> William Zinsser, *[On Writing Well](https://bookshop.org/p/books/on-writing-well-the-classic-guide-to-writing-nonfiction-william-zinsser/8860186?ean=9780060891541)*

For a working example, go watch *That Thing You Do,* then watch the three-hour director's cut. The former is a masterpiece, the latter a slog.

A final caveat: Don't confuse depiction with evocation. You don't have to bore the reader to show a bored character any more than you have to kill the reader to show a character being killed.

### Don't confuse them

If the reader can't figure out what's going on, it's only a matter of time before their confusion becomes frustration and they quit the story altogether.

Arousing confusion is not the same as arousing interest.

## Whiteboard

But there has to an element of design when you’re writing entertainment. Whether you’re doing it consciously or subsconsciously, the design is there. Some people seem to be able to do this automatically. I’ve tried it. I’m also tried being a planner. There is a certain spontaneouty that happens when you get really sucked into a story, and when that happens it makes no sense to fight the current. But in general, I have a hard time working this way. I need a little more structure. In order to design a story, you have to know what you’re trying to get. It requires you to take the audience’s perspective. You aren’t just writing for you. You’re perofmring. And you want the performance to be successful. So you have to take pains to surprise the audience. To thrill them. To know what they want from you and what you want from them. 



When you write entertainment, what you’re doing is designing an experience.

It also might depend on the story itself. It might be a more artistic story, or it might be more of a romp. You could make the argument that the ideal is a blend. But then you’d be implying that there’s such a thing as an ideal story, and of course there isn’t. There’s just stories. And the story that works is the one that knows what it is, what it’s trying to do, and does it well. 

In an art piece, you want to approach from, what would the character do, regardless of whether it’s the most entertaining option. Audience satisfaction isn’t the goal. The goal is to tell a story that’s true to itself. And if that’s your goal, who says there’s any guarantee that the story will be satisfying? But if you’re writing to entertain, the goal becomes audience satisfaction. That doesn’t mean pandering. It just means that if you have a story deicions to make, the right decision is whichever one is more exicting. By default. 

It’s more complicated than that of course, because you can’t just blow up a building every time the story starts to drag. You have to earn the excitement by crafting a narrative that trips whatever trigger it is that engages us in a story. I guess what it is is you’re essentially tricking the brain into thinking these are real people. The most blatant example is horror. If there wasn’t some part of your brain that *really thought* it was real, horror would ineffective. But all stories work this way. If there wasn’t some part of your brain that *really thought* these characters were real, you wouldn’t care about them. They’d be objects. Interesting objects. But objects.

Entertainment is the art of emotional manipulation. Art is the art of art. There’s a part of me that thinks that’s dangerous road because usually I try not to worry about things I can’t control. How other people feel about something I write is one of those things. But that’s not the game. The game is, can I get the reaction I’m looking for? Am I a good enough emotional chessmaster to guide a reader on the emotional journey I want them to take? 

Everyone has their method. Maybe it’s just a matter of where your derive your satisfaction. For me, I want to entertain. I like being entertained, and that’s what I want to do for other people. I like being thoughtful too, but so often cerebralness turns drab beacuse you’re too afraid to let loose. It gets boring. You get too concerned with ideas and forget to tell a story. 

In my mind, a story exists for its own sake. It’s not a vehicle for my brilliant insights. It’s just a machine. And if I can make one that works, I’ll be happy.

Stories work because of empathy. The things that happen to the characters happen to us. When they win, we win. When they get hurt, we get hurt. But we’re willing to do that at all because it’s a risk free propsition. We can be vulnerable with a story the way it’s very scary to be in real life. We can’t just go around giving our hearts to everyone we meet or we’d be devstated daily anew. But we can give our hearts to an infinite amount of characters in as many stories and never suffer for it. [^1]

Because I think it affects the overall approach. Though not necessarily. Because some writers who I’d consider entertinament writers (Stephen King) seem to approach it in a more artistic way. He’s not a planner in other words. He watches what happens, and writes it down, which sounds a lot more like the approach of a spontaneous artist than a deliberate craftsman.

Art is about expression. Entertainment... Art is for grown ups. Entertainment is for children, or grown ups who don’t feel like being grown ups right now.

I think of art as more fluid, more indiosyncratic, more nuanced? It comes from the writer. It’s working from inward out. But entertainment is designed to...entertain. Therefore it’s an audience first mindset. So it’s purely about, what’s the reaction I’m trying to get, and how do I get it. What makes the most entertaining story? Art is more, what am I trying to say? It’s about expression. Entertainment is more, what’s the most entertaining story? The reason I like the second approach is because it separates me from the story. It treats the story like it’s own reason for existing. It doesn’t need a theme to ground it, because it’s it’s own machine desinged to do a thing and it does it well. And so because it works, it gets to exist.

Stories are written for audiences. In a sense, you are performing. A magician can't fool himself. *He* knows it's an act. His job is to get the audience to forget it's an act. You have to make them believe. Remember the audience. Trying to impress them will force you to play your best hand. It's a hedge against laziness.

---

Stories are both built and woven. Scenes and paragraphs are like bricks, sentences are like threads.

---

Think of it like you're explaining the story to yourself, or to a friend, or to a child. I say explaining, because that puts an emphasis on clarity. But remember that it is also a story, so you're also trying to impress. It can be hard to impress yourself, hence why it can be helpful to imagine you're telling the story to a child or a friend.

---

The only--the ONLY--goal in storytelling is to get the reader to turn the page.

---

One thing I do is try not to get too personal with it. I try to think of it as just a cool thing I’m making. It’s not an opus. Just a neat little thing I’ve built. That helps lower the stakes, makes it feel more like a game, which in turn helps it to be more engaging. I like the putting together of words. When I successfully piece together a sentence, and then a paragraph, and it seems to be working, that’s where I get the rush. So that’s what I focus on. The building of it, one word at a time.

---

What's the difference, after all, between building a website and building a story? They're both objects that are designed to do things. A website is designed to convey information. A story is designed to convey and experience, whether that experience is one of entertainment, joy, sadness. Whatever it is, it is defined by the intent, which is defined by whatever we are trying to make the audience feel.

So a story is an object. It is a thing built. So let's start talking about it that way.

The other reason to think of this as a craft is that that is the only way to take satisfaction in the detials. Which is to say, remain process-oriented. The only way to enjoy writing, to enjoy making anything, is to enjoy the process. You may want the result, but the process is how you get there, and you never will unless you take some satisfaction in the craftsmanship. If you can learn to enjoy the craft, you don't even have to learn patience. Patience is just a matter of how persistent you are in your problem solving. And the persistence comes from relishing the challenge.

I once heard someone describe their process as a cat going over itself with its tongue over and again until it’s clean. That’s more less how I operate. I write the scene, then I go over it again and again until it’s clean. It’s not really so cut and dried, because if I spend too much time on one scene I start to lose my sense of it, at which point it usually helps to move onto the next. But that’s the process. You move on down, that’s one lick. Then you go back to the top and start the process over. You do as many licks as you need to until it’s clean.

---

%% This goes with the craft not an art thing. %%

I do get a little tired of “writing is rewrting,” because like any aphorism people repeat it like it’s supposed to be obvious. What they don’t do is bother to expound. But all it means, *all* it means, is that very rarely does anything come out right the first time. But the beauty of text editors is that there is precisely zero cost in just getting the thought down. You don’t waste time (you probably save it), you don’t waste space, you don’t waste paper. So get it down, then rework it. Aphorisms are shorthand. They are not the wisdom itself. They are meant to remind you of the wisdom.

> *most of these people that talk about writing for screenplays if they were teaching acting they would be thrown out and ridiculed they all seem to be result oriented and real actors aren't result oriented but real writers aren't result oriented i mean the actor wants everything they do to be magnificent and the writer wants everything they do to be magnificent but novelists aren't result oriented it's the doing of it it's the process it's the getting there it's it's the journey it's it's it's the journey is everything the journey makes the destination worthwhile you can only have a worthwhile destination after you've had a worthwhile journey and novelists trust that actors trust that they trust that they live the part and they are honest and they don't try to predetermine too much that the ultimately the ultimate end result will be rewarding and it seems like people who teach screenwriting go in the opposite direction if you're judging it by a coloring book and you're getting a's for keeping your colors inside of the lines then maybe they are right but i that's not how i want to judge it*
