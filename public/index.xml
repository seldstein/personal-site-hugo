      <description>In college I took a poetry seminar, not because I had any interest in poetry, but because I thought it would be easy. (Not that it&amp;rsquo;s important, but I was right. There was no homework. We didn&amp;rsquo;t even have to write poetry.) The professor&amp;rsquo;s name was Ryan Tucker. He was an adjunct, I think, and couldn&amp;rsquo;t have been much older than I am now. Often he&amp;rsquo;d begin class with a video or a song, sometimes to illustrate a point, but also because he apparently thought learning should be fun, a virtue I would appreciate long before I came to recognize it.</description>

      <title>Mining and Refining: The Two Modes of Writing</title>
      <link>https://samfeldstein.xyz/posts/spontaneity-codified/</link>

      <description>There are two modes of writing: mining and refining. You&amp;rsquo;re either digging for coal, or pressing it into diamonds.&#xA;When you mine, you search for raw material. That might look like brainstorming, it might look like research, it might look like eavesdropping. It might look like nothing. You&amp;rsquo;re watching a movie and it sparks a notion, you write it down.&#xA;That last example is a little different from the others. It feels passive.</description>

      <description>And now&#xA;taken by the urge&#xA;I will create.&#xA;I will create ruthlessly.&#xA;I will call forth from the depths of imagination&#xA;a world&#xA;and creatures big and small to populate it.&#xA;I will force the breath of life&#xA;down the throats of peaceful sleepers&#xA;who did not ask to be woken.&#xA;Their heads will turn at my Word.&#xA;Their mouths will open at my behest&#xA;and they will proclaim my supremacy.</description>

      <description>In the beginning, it wasn’t, and then it was, and it has been ever since. It is, was, and will be, the First.&#xA;The First knows some things. It knows, for instance, that there is no here or there. Rather, the nature of there is to not be here. And there, here is there, and there is here. The First also knows that there is no such thing as chance. All things that could be, are.</description>

      <description>Some reproving tongues wag&#xA;sanctimonious&#xA;about tales and canards&#xA;only to return to their parlors&#xA;and bedrooms&#xA;and other shrouded places&#xA;and lap up the scuttlebutt&#xA;like so much sweet ambrosia.&#xA;Notes I don&amp;rsquo;t write poetry much, but I do enjoy cadence, and if I ever did become a poet, that would be why. This poem came out of a horror novel I started last year. I abandoned the novel but kept the poem.</description>

      <description>Paul Graham once described prestige as a magnet that warps your ability to tell the difference between what you like and what you&amp;rsquo;d like to like. I think that&amp;rsquo;s right, and I think you could extend the analogy to any number of confounding forces (desire, greed, peer pressure, parental pressure, societal pressure, how good you are at lying to yourself, conventional wisdom, overconfidence, underconfidence, misguided devotion to a bygone aspiration, et al) that distort your thinking, cloud your motives, and altogether make understanding yourself and why you do the things you do much harder than understanding yourself and why you do the things you do has any right to be.</description>

      <description>Hi, I’m Sam Feldstein. I used to want to be an author, but lately I&amp;rsquo;m more interested in web design. I&amp;rsquo;m fond of blogs, books, movies, and photography.&#xA;The best way to keep up with my work is to subscribe to my RSS feed. If you don&amp;rsquo;t use RSS, I also have a mailing list.&#xA;Things I Use I don&amp;rsquo;t write fiction so much anymore, but when I did I used Scrivener.</description>

      <description>Once a month I back up my Goodreads library to a folder on my computer called exports. The process: Go to the website, find the Export button, download the file, open the terminal, move the file from Downloads to exports. It&amp;rsquo;s not enough of a pain for me not to do it, but it is enough of a pain for me to try to make it easier. I figured there had to be an extant solution, but rather than hunt around the internet for an appropriate application, I decided to build one myself.</description>

      <title>It&#39;s Not the Story&#39;s Fault You Thought You Were Still on the Ranch</title>

      <description>These aren&amp;rsquo;t young soldiers Lonesome Dove is a story about the lust for adventure, a force so powerful it can rip you from the arms of comfort and chuck you into the jaws of death. Daredevils everywhere will relate to Gus and Woodrow. They are men who can&amp;rsquo;t stand to sit still. Nobody makes them leave Lonesome Dove. They leave because they&amp;rsquo;re bored. Thus, their subsequent wounds are self-inflicted. These guys aren&amp;rsquo;t naive.</description>

      <description>I was working on a short story about an exorcist (which I&amp;rsquo;ve since abandoned) so I decided to read The Exorcist. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen the movie but can&amp;rsquo;t say I&amp;rsquo;m a fan. The book is excellent. One passage stood out. It&amp;rsquo;s said by Merrin, the senior exorcist, to Damien, the amateur who&amp;rsquo;s been having a crisis of faith:&#xA;Long ago I despaired of ever loving my neighbor. Certain people repelled me. How could I love them?</description>

      <description>Early October I went to South Dakota for the first time since I was a kid. I have a friend from college whose parents own a cabin in the Black Hills which she and her boyfriend (also a college friend) go to a few times a year, and I’d been talking about going with them for some time. I landed in Sioux Falls. My friends were driving from Des Moines, so it worked out that they could pick me up from the airport and we set out from there.</description>

      <description>Sam Spade exhibits a degree of unhinged lunacy on par with Hamlet, and there’s something to that, isn’t there, because you know what they have in common? They’re both damaged goods. Hamlet’s uncle killed his father and then had shameless carnal relations with his mother. It’s enough to drive anyone to San Francisco, and Sam, well we don’t know what he’s been through but part of the art of filmmaking as John Huston so deftly demonstrates is knowing what to say and when to say it, yes, but also knowing what not to say.</description>

      <title>Cinderella in Reverse: &#39;Roman Holiday&#39;</title>

      <description>Perhaps it’s her eyes, or how her expression always bespeaks the shadow of a smile, even when she’s crying, but we warm to Princess Ann straightaway. Of course it helps that she’s young and Audrey Hepburn, but really it has to do with the way we meet her; in the midst of a lengthy and exhausting royal public relations tour of Europe. By the time she finally finishes shaking the hands of an endless entourage of aristocrats and (one presumes) eligible bachelors, she has us completely.</description>

      <title>Absence of Meaning in &#39;The Lighthouse&#39;</title>
      <link>https://samfeldstein.xyz/posts/the-lighthouse/</link>

      <description>All movies have to become real, on some level, in order to do their good work, and some of them can only achieve this by taking active steps to distance themselves from reality. All movies do this to some extent simply by appearing on a screen, but some of them, as with The Lighthouse, need a little more than that. Eggers’s choice to shoot on 35mm negative in an aspect ratio of 1.</description>
