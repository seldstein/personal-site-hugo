      <description>Hi, I’m Sam Feldstein. I used to want to be an author, but lately I&amp;rsquo;m more interested in web design. I&amp;rsquo;m fond of blogs, books, movies, and photography.&#xA;Things I Use For long-form fiction, I use Scrivener. For writing everything else, taking notes, and managing files, I use Obsidian with the Minimal theme and the following community plugins:&#xA;Hider LanguageTool Integration Minimal Theme Settings Omnivore Readwise Official Typewriter Mode Enso is a fantastic tool for distraction-free word-dumping.</description>

      <title>Building an Automatic File-Mover with ChatGPT</title>

      <description>Once a month I back up my Goodreads library to a folder on my computer called exports. The process: Go to the website, find the Export button, download the file, open the terminal, move the file from Downloads to exports. It&amp;rsquo;s not enough of a pain for me not to do it, but it is enough of a pain for me to try to make it easier. I figured there had to be an extant solution, but rather than hunt around the internet for an appropriate application, I decided to build one myself.</description>

      <title>It&#39;s Not the Story&#39;s Fault You Thought You Were Still on the Ranch</title>

      <description>These aren&amp;rsquo;t young soldiers Lonesome Dove is a story about the lust for adventure, a force so powerful it can rip you from the arms of comfort and chuck you into the jaws of death. Daredevils everywhere will relate to Gus and Woodrow. They are men who can&amp;rsquo;t stand to sit still. Nobody makes them leave Lonesome Dove. They leave because they&amp;rsquo;re bored. Thus, their subsequent wounds are self-inflicted. These guys aren&amp;rsquo;t naive.</description>

      <title>And God Said, &#34;Care, Dammit&#34;</title>

      <description>I was working on a short story about an exorcist (which I&amp;rsquo;ve since abandoned) so I decided to read The Exorcist. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen the movie but can&amp;rsquo;t say I&amp;rsquo;m a fan. The book is excellent. One passage stood out. It&amp;rsquo;s said by Merrin, the senior exorcist, to Damien, the amateur who&amp;rsquo;s been having a crisis of faith:&#xA;Long ago I despaired of ever loving my neighbor. Certain people repelled me. How could I love them?</description>

      <title>Buffalo Sorting and My First Gambling Foray</title>

      <description>Early October I went to South Dakota for the first time since I was a kid. I have a friend from college whose parents own a cabin in the Black Hills which she and her boyfriend (also a college friend) go to a few times a year, and I’d been talking about going with them for some time. I landed in Sioux Falls. My friends were driving from Des Moines, so it worked out that they could pick me up from the airport and we set out from there.</description>

      <title>Riddled with Words: &#39;The Maltese Falcon&#39;</title>

      <description>Sam Spade exhibits a degree of unhinged lunacy on par with Hamlet, and there’s something to that, isn’t there, because you know what they have in common? They’re both damaged goods. Hamlet’s uncle killed his father and then had shameless carnal relations with his mother. It’s enough to drive anyone to San Francisco, and Sam, well we don’t know what he’s been through but part of the art of filmmaking as John Huston so deftly demonstrates is knowing what to say and when to say it, yes, but also knowing what not to say.</description>

      <title>Cinderella in Reverse: &#39;Roman Holiday&#39;</title>

      <description>Perhaps it’s her eyes, or how her expression always bespeaks the shadow of a smile, even when she’s crying, but we warm to Princess Ann straightaway. Of course it helps that she’s young and Audrey Hepburn, but really it has to do with the way we meet her; in the midst of a lengthy and exhausting royal public relations tour of Europe. By the time she finally finishes shaking the hands of an endless entourage of aristocrats and (one presumes) eligible bachelors, she has us completely.</description>

      <title>Absence of Meaning in &#39;The Lighthouse&#39;</title>

      <description>All movies have to become real, on some level, in order to do their good work, and some of them can only achieve this by taking active steps to distance themselves from reality. All movies do this to some extent simply by appearing on a screen, but some of them, as with The Lighthouse, need a little more than that. Eggers’s choice to shoot on 35mm negative in an aspect ratio of 1.</description>
