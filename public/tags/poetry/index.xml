      <description>In college I took a poetry seminar, not because I had any interest in poetry, but because I thought it would be easy. (Not that it&amp;rsquo;s important, but I was right. There was no homework. We didn&amp;rsquo;t even have to write poetry.) The professor&amp;rsquo;s name was Ryan Tucker. He was an adjunct, I think, and couldn&amp;rsquo;t have been much older than I am now. Often he&amp;rsquo;d begin class with a video or a song, sometimes to illustrate a point, but also because he apparently thought learning should be fun, a virtue I would appreciate long before I came to recognize it.</description>

      <description>And now
taken by the urge
I will create.
I will create ruthlessly.
I will call forth from the depths of imagination
a world
and creatures big and small to populate it.
I will force the breath of life
down the throats of peaceful sleepers
who did not ask to be woken.
Their heads will turn at my Word.
Their mouths will open at my behest
and they will proclaim my supremacy.</description>

      <description>Some reproving tongues wag
sanctimonious
about tales and canards
only to return to their parlors
and bedrooms
and other shrouded places
and lap up the scuttlebutt
like so much sweet ambrosia.
Notes I don&amp;rsquo;t write poetry much, but I do enjoy cadence, and if I ever did become a poet, that would be why. This poem came out of a horror novel I started last year. I abandoned the novel but kept the poem.</description>
