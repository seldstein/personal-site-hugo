      <description>These aren&amp;rsquo;t young soldiers Lonesome Dove is a story about the lust for adventure, a force so powerful it can rip you from the arms of comfort and chuck you into the jaws of death. Daredevils everywhere will relate to Gus and Woodrow. They are men who can&amp;rsquo;t stand to sit still. Nobody makes them leave Lonesome Dove. They leave because they&amp;rsquo;re bored. Thus, their subsequent wounds are self-inflicted. These guys aren&amp;rsquo;t naive.</description>

By the time she finally finishes shaking the hands of an endless entourage of aristocrats and (one presumes) eligible bachelors, she has us completely.</description>
