                        <p><span class="text1">Based on decades of research, many personality
                                researchers agree that the most important individual differences in
                                people's personality traits are captured by five basic dimensions known
                                as the "Big Five": Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness,
                                Negative Emotionality, and Open-Mindedness. The questionnaire you just
                                completed is the Big Five Inventoryâ€“2, or BFI-2 for short, developed by
                                researchers Christopher J. Soto and Oliver P. John. As its name
                                suggests, the BFI-2 is designed to measure the core aspects of each Big
                                Five personality dimension.</span></p>
                        <p><span class="text1">The BFI-2 provides scores on the Big Five
                                personality traits, and on 15 more-specific "facet" traits that make up
                                the Big Five. Your scores on all of these personality traits are
                                presented in the tables below, along with a brief description of people
                                who score high vs. low on each trait. While reviewing this information,
                                it's important to keep in mind that the BFI was not developed to be a
                                clinical measure, and is not used to identify mental health problems.
                                Instead, it measures normal personality traits that everyone has to a
                                greater or lesser degree.</span></p>
