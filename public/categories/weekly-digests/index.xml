      <description>New post(s) alert In case you missed them, I wrote two new posts this week: a short one about Talmudic wisdom in The Exorcist (the book, not the movie) and a longer one about shock and Lonesome Dove (the movie, not the book). (It&#39;s actually a miniseries but I really wanted to capitalize on that symmetry just now.)&#xA;New publication(s) alert This week I have the pleasure of announcing that my short story &amp;quot;The Man Who Was a Boy Made of Memories&amp;quot; was just published on the Tales to Terrify podcast.</description>

      <description>News My big update is that this website exists. I&#39;ve been flirting with blogging for years now, but I&#39;ve never committed to it. I&#39;ve created and deleted several websites--mostly out of self-consciousness and an inability to decide how to spend my time--but this one looks like it&#39;s here to stay. I&#39;m really happy with how it turned out. I&#39;ve been slowly learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript over the last two years or so, first via The Odin Project and then MDN Web Docs.</description>
