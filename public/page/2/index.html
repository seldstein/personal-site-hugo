lived in Marfa, Texas. A friend of a friend was hosting a beat poetry night in honor of what would have been Jack Kerouac&rsquo;s 100th birthday. When he found out I held a writing degree from the University of Iowa (the undergraduate program, not the Writers&rsquo; Workshop), he invited me to write something to read at the party.</p><p>To be clear, I know nothing about poetry or Jack Kerouac. But what the hell, anybody can write nonsense. The resulting poem turned out to be a pretty nice exercise in cadence. Note that it&rsquo;s meant to be performed, not read, so if there&rsquo;s no one around (or even if there is), feel free to shout it out.</p></article><article><header class=header-page><time class=date datetime=2024-02-06T09:12:16-06:00>February 06, 2024</time><h2 class=h1><a href=/posts/get-out-of-the-water/>Get Out of the Water</a></h2><div class=deck>On worry, intuition, and trying new things.</div><div class=container-meta><ul class=list-meta><li>#<a href=/tags/life/>life</a></li><li>#<a href=/tags/work/>work</a></li></ul></div></header><p>Paul Graham once described <a href=https://www.paulgraham.com/love.html>prestige as a magnet</a> that warps your ability to tell the difference between what you like and what you&rsquo;d like to like. I think that&rsquo;s right, and I think you could extend the analogy to any number of confounding forces (desire, greed, peer pressure, parental pressure, societal pressure, how good you are at lying to yourself, conventional wisdom, overconfidence, underconfidence, misguided devotion to a bygone aspiration, et al) that distort your thinking, cloud your motives, and altogether make understanding yourself and why you do the things you do much harder than understanding yourself and why you do the things you do has any right to be.</p><p>An example: For a long time I wanted to be a screenwriter. That was my first real aspiration, and I pursued it at a steady-ish pace for about nine years. But in all that time, I finished just one screenplay and a handful of short stories. Eventually, I began to wonder if I liked writing at all. It was a question easier asked than answered, because I was attempting to answer it while under the influence of several magnets. There was the Dubious Magnet of Underconfidence, child of the Brittle Magnet of Low Self-Esteem; the Statistically-Backed Magnet of Sunk Costs; the Misguided Magnet of Devotion to a Bygone Aspiration; and the Supreme Magnet of Not Trusting Myself. Any thinking about whether I liked writing was followed by pondering about whether I was thinking clearly about whether I liked writing, and the pondering in turn was followed by brooding over whether I was pondering clearly about thinking clearly about whether I liked writing. I&rsquo;d get so turned around that I&rsquo;d go back to writing simply because it was simpler, and because, frankly, I didn&rsquo;t have a better idea.</p><p>Magnets are like pythons: the more you struggle, the tighter they squeeze you. The only way to escape is to relax, stop thinking, and let intuition take the wheel. (Disclaimer: This strategy has not been tested on actual pythons.) That&rsquo;s not to say it&rsquo;s as simple as closing your eyes and &ldquo;listening to your gut.&rdquo; Intuition is a powerful machine, but it&rsquo;s useless without data. That data comes from experience. I don&rsquo;t have to wonder if I prefer West Texas summers to Iowa winters. I <em>know</em> I prefer West Texas summers to Iowa winters because I&rsquo;ve lived through both. If you&rsquo;re a fish and you suspect, given all you&rsquo;ve heard, that you might like living on dry land, no amount of cool-headed theorizing or desperate agonizing will help you, because it&rsquo;s impossible to tell if you like living on dry land based on what you <em>think</em> living on dry land <em>might</em> be like. If you want to know if you like living on dry land, you have to get out of the water.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t until I started coding that I finally realized how much I didn&rsquo;t like writing (fiction writing, mind you). I&rsquo;d been forcing words onto the page for so long that I&rsquo;d forgotten what it felt like to enjoy something that was also hard. Far from forcing myself to code, I couldn&rsquo;t <em>stop</em> myself from coding. I didn&rsquo;t have to wonder anymore if I liked writing. I <em>knew</em> I didn&rsquo;t like writing because I&rsquo;d found something much more engaging.</p><p>One caveat here is that you won&rsquo;t have a strong preference for most things. If you, the fish, get out of the water and find that the beach isn&rsquo;t doing it for you, don&rsquo;t worry about it, and don&rsquo;t settle. Instead, go to the forest and see how that feels. If that doesn&rsquo;t work, try the Arctic. You may find that you don&rsquo;t have a strong preference for any climate. That&rsquo;s okay, too. All it means is that your environment isn&rsquo;t as important to you as you thought it was. That&rsquo;s good data. Collect it, and carry on. Keep feeding the machine.</p><p>And don&rsquo;t worry about wasting time. Worrying about wasting time is a waste of time. Trying things isn&rsquo;t. When you get out of the water, life becomes more interesting and more fun. You&rsquo;ll do things you wouldn&rsquo;t have done otherwise. You&rsquo;ll go places you wouldn&rsquo;t have gone, see things you wouldn&rsquo;t have seen, and meet people you wouldn&rsquo;t have met, and the next time you find yourself talking to someone you feel the inexplicable need to impress, you&rsquo;ll have a story to tell.</p><p>Another caveat is that while strong preferences are obvious, they aren&rsquo;t always obvious immediately. To know if you like something, you have to spend some time with it. When I first started coding, I was too intimidated to like it. I don&rsquo;t have a mathy brain, and it seemed like the kind of thing that only people with mathy brains were good at. It took two years of dabbling to convince me that coding was something I could do. Only then did I start to like it. That&rsquo;s the catch-22 here: You don&rsquo;t want to spend any more time than necessary doing things you don&rsquo;t like, but you don&rsquo;t necessarily know if you like or dislike something until you&rsquo;ve spent a little time with it.</p><p>The best thing you can do is leave yourself alone. Try to relax. Untether yourself, and see where you drift. If you keep drifting back to something, don&rsquo;t question it. <em>A Serious Man</em> is one of my favorite movies. The first time I saw it, my reaction was a question mark. The second time I saw it, my reaction was a question mark and a smile. The third time I saw it, I fell in love. I don&rsquo;t know what soundless voice it was that coaxed me into revisiting the movie, and I don&rsquo;t care. But it&rsquo;s still there, and I&rsquo;m still listening.</p><h2 id=further-reading>Further Reading</h2><ul><li><a href=https://www.paulgraham.com/love.html>How to Do What You Love</a> by Paul Graham</li><li><a href=https://www.themarginalian.org/2012/02/27/purpose-work-love/>How to Find Your Purpose and Do What You Love</a> by Maria Popova</li><li><a href=https://waitbutwhy.com/2018/04/picking-career.html>How to Pick a Career (That Actually Fits You)</a> by Tim Urban</li></ul></article><article><header class=header-page><time class=date datetime=2023-12-16T08:53:53-06:00>December 16, 2023</time><h2 class=h1><a href=/posts/file-mover/>Building an Automatic File-Mover with ChatGPT</a></h2><div class=deck>Nothing special.</div><div class=container-meta><ul class=list-meta><li>#<a href=/tags/ai/>ai</a></li><li>#<a href=/tags/coding/>coding</a></li><li>#<a href=/tags/python/>python</a></li><li>#<a href=/tags/tools/>tools</a></li></ul></div></header><p>Once a month I back up my Goodreads library to a folder on my computer called <code>exports</code>. The process: Go to the website, find the Export button, download the file, open the terminal, move the file from <code>Downloads</code> to <code>exports</code>. It&rsquo;s not enough of a pain for me not to do it, but it is enough of a pain for me to try to make it easier. I figured there had to be an extant solution, but rather than hunt around the internet for an appropriate application, I decided to build one myself.</p><p>The thing is, I don&rsquo;t know any Python. I barely know JavaScript. So I turned to ChatGPT for help, and short story short, it was really easy. The app is very simple. All it does is check my computer&rsquo;s <code>Downloads</code> folder for a specific file (in this case, <code>goodreads*.csv</code>)and move it to the <code>exports</code> folder.</p><p>Slightly more complicated (remember that I&rsquo;m new to all this) was setting the application to run automatically once a month. You do that with something called a &ldquo;cron job&rdquo;. To schedule a cron job, you first open the &ldquo;crontab&rdquo; with <code>crontab -e</code>. Then you enter the interval, the path to the Python interpreter, and the path to the application. Like so:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-shell data-lang=shell><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#ae81ff>0</span> <span style=color:#ae81ff>0</span> <span style=color:#ae81ff>1</span> * * usr/bin/python3 /Users/User/path/to/file-mover/script.py
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The first interval field represents minutes. Setting it to <code>0</code> tells the application to run at the top of the hour. The second field represents hours. Setting it to <code>0</code> tells the app to run at midnight. The third field represents days. Setting it to <code>1</code> tells the app to run on the first day of the month. The fourth field represents months. Setting it to <code>*</code> tells the app to run every month. The fifth field represents the day of the week. Setting it to <code>*</code> allows the app to run on any given day. Taken together, this tells the app to run at midnight on the first day of each month.</p><p>Now the process from before has been reduced to a single step. All I have to do is download the export file from Goodreads, and the app handles the rest.</p><p>You can see the code on <a href=https://github.com/seldstein/file-mover>GitHub</a>.</p></article><article><header class=header-page><time class=date datetime=2023-12-05T20:23:25-06:00>December 05, 2023</time><h2 class=h1><a href=/posts/lonesome-dove/>It's Not the Story's Fault You Thought You Were Still on the Ranch</a></h2><div class=deck>Two short essays and one longish essay inspired by 'Lonesome Dove.'</div><div class=container-meta><ul class=list-meta><li>#<a href=/tags/movies/>movies</a></li><li>#<a href=/tags/romance/>romance</a></li><li>#<a href=/tags/tv/>tv</a></li><li>#<a href=/tags/westerns/>westerns</a></li></ul></div></header><h2 id=these-arent-young-soldiers>These aren&rsquo;t young soldiers</h2><p><em>Lonesome Dove</em> is a story about the lust for adventure, a force so powerful it can rip you from the arms of comfort and chuck you into the jaws of death. Daredevils everywhere will relate to Gus and Woodrow. They are men who can&rsquo;t stand to sit still. Nobody makes them leave Lonesome Dove. They leave because they&rsquo;re bored. Thus, their subsequent wounds are self-inflicted. These guys aren&rsquo;t naive. They&rsquo;re not young soldiers harboring idealized notions of war. They know blood, and they know battle, and they know terror and they know anguish. They don&rsquo;t leave Lonesome Dove despite these things; they leave because of them. The danger is the point. Gus and Woodrow risk grief and pain so that when death does inevitably come for them, they can greet it feeling like they&rsquo;ve lived.</p><h2 id=the-vanity-of-grand-romance>The vanity of grand romance</h2><p>When you decide you&rsquo;re in love with someone, when you fixate on somebody in that way, what you&rsquo;ve inadvertently done is made them a major character in the story you&rsquo;re writing about yourself. And what you&rsquo;ve also done is decided, subconsciously, that the only way your story can have a happy ending is if you and the object of your affection get together at the end of it. You&rsquo;ve seen this attitude toward love affirmed a thousand times in romances, romantic comedies, and romantic epics. What <em>Lonesome Dove</em> does is less common. The series takes that grand romantic arc that is so familiar and reveals a side of it&ndash;or an iteration of it&ndash;that is delusional, conceited, and vainglorious. Which is to say, sometimes you cross a thousand miles of prairie in order to reunite with the love of your life only to find that they&rsquo;re writing a story of their own, and you&rsquo;re not in it.</p><h2 id=its-not-the-storys-fault-you-thought-you-were-still-on-the-ranch>It&rsquo;s not the story&rsquo;s fault you thought you were still on the ranch</h2><p><a href=https://markmanson.net/why-happiness-is-overrated>Mark Manson</a> defines emotion, and I&rsquo;m paraphrasing here, as the product of a misalignment between our expectations and reality. We expect one thing to happen, but then something else happens, and we feel a way about it. That way might be good or bad. When life is better than we expect, we might experience happiness. When life is worse than we expect, we might experience sadness. And depending on the extent to which our expectations are violated, we might feel those emotions to a greater or lesser degree. When life isn&rsquo;t just better but <em>way</em> better than we expect, maybe we experience not just happiness but <em>elation.</em> Likewise, when life isn&rsquo;t just worse but <em>way</em> worse than we expect, maybe we experience not just sadness but <em>devastation.</em> If we follow that train of thought, we can come up with a working definition of the emotion we&rsquo;re here to talk about, which is shock. In the same way that we might define devastation as &ldquo;sadness, but more so,&rdquo; we might define shock as &ldquo;surprise, but more so.&rdquo;</p><p>Let&rsquo;s imagine for a moment that you&rsquo;re browsing the shelves in a video rental store (let&rsquo;s also imagine for a moment that video rental stores still exist) and you come across a copy of <em>Avengers: Endgame.</em> Only this copy of <em>Endgame</em> doesn&rsquo;t look quite right. The costumes look a little off, some of the actors are different, and the description on the back doesn&rsquo;t match the movie you remember. And since you can pretty readily tell that it&rsquo;s not a porno, you rightly conclude that it&rsquo;s a version of <em>Endgame</em> from an alternate universe. Naturally you&rsquo;re curious, so you take it home and pop it in your VCR player and you sit down to watch. And for the first few scenes the movie feels pretty much like you&rsquo;d expect. Again, some of the actors and costumes are different, but the production value is there, it&rsquo;s no knockoff, and by and large it feels like a Marvel movie should feel. It&rsquo;s light, it&rsquo;s fun, it&rsquo;s melodramatic. There&rsquo;s danger, but that danger is accompanied by, in the back of your mind, an essential understanding that everything&rsquo;s going to turn out okay.</p><p>And then comes a scene where Captain America has to face down one of Thanos&rsquo;s henchman. They&rsquo;re going head-to-head, and for a while it seems like a pretty even match, and you&rsquo;re not sure if Captain America&rsquo;s going to win but you&rsquo;re pretty sure (again, because of that essential understanding) that he&rsquo;s at least going to come out of this relatively unscathed. But then something happens that you don&rsquo;t expect. The henchman pulls a knife from his boot and plunges it into Captain America&rsquo;s stomach. He twists the blade and wrenches it upward, then yanks it out and Captain America&rsquo;s guts spill all over the floor. Cap falls to his knees, screaming in agony. Tears spill down his face as he tries in vain to stuff his own entrails back into his body. He screams for an agonizingly long time, perhaps minutes, until finally the henchman steps forward and finishes the job, and that&rsquo;s the end of Captain America.</p><p>How would you react to that? Everybody&rsquo;s different, so maybe some of you would be horrified, maybe some of you would find it comical, but I imagine that everybody, to one degree or another, would be pretty taken aback. And the reason you&rsquo;d be taken aback is that you weren&rsquo;t expecting that kind of behavior from a Marvel movie. If you were watching a different movie or show, say, <em>Game of Thrones</em>, it&rsquo;d be a different story. The scene would still be upsetting, but you wouldn&rsquo;t be taken aback. Because you <em>do</em> expect that kind of behavior from <em>Game of Thrones.</em> That&rsquo;s that world. But it&rsquo;s not Marvel. So by disemboweling Captain America, the alternate version of <em>Endgame</em> shattered your understanding of the world you thought you were in. That&rsquo;s how stories shock you: by introducing you to a world that seems to be governed by certain rules, and then doing something that seems to violate those rules.</p><p>Now, the tricky thing about shock is that if you&rsquo;re already expecting a certain kind of behavior from a story, then the story can&rsquo;t shock you with it. But if you aren&rsquo;t expecting such behavior, and then the story behaves that way, you&rsquo;ll feel like you&rsquo;ve been cheated. You&rsquo;ll feel like you&rsquo;ve been lied to. So how does a story strike that balance? By laying the groundwork. If a story that shocks you is doing its job right, the shocking thing that it does doesn&rsquo;t <em>actually</em> violate its established rules. If a story is doing its job right, it&rsquo;s been telling you exactly what it is the whole time.</p><p>Chris Cooper in <em>Lonesome Dove</em> plays July Johnson, a goodhearted but somewhat irresolute sheriff who&rsquo;s strong-armed by a woman into tracking down her husband&rsquo;s killer. And July&rsquo;s wife (played by Glenne Headly) makes him take their young son Bryan along so she can run off back to the guy she really wants to be married to. That feels a bit convoluted but it&rsquo;s not important. What&rsquo;s important is that July takes his kid into the wilderness to track down a murderer, and unfortunately for them, their path crosses with that of Blue Duck, a vicious bandit and the villain of the series. I don&rsquo;t recall the exact scenario, I think July and Bryan find some of Blue Duck&rsquo;s victims or something, but anyway July tells Bryan to stay back while he goes down the hill to check for survivors. And so he goes down the hill, and while he&rsquo;s down there Blue Duck emerges from the bushes and kills Bryan. He kills the little boy. With a knife.</p><p>I was shocked. And more than shocked, I was upset. I was upset because I felt betrayed. And I felt betrayed because I didn&rsquo;t think this was a world where kids got murdered. I felt like the story had cheated.</p><p>Whenever I feel this way about a story, there are generally two possibilities: Either the story fucked up, or I did. <em>Lonesome Dove</em> is a miniseries based on a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. I&rsquo;m a person who is somewhat less accomplished than that. It seemed prudent to give the series the benefit of the doubt. Anyway I liked the show, I knew it was something of quality, so I sat down to figure out if maybe I&rsquo;d missed something. It didn&rsquo;t take long to realize that the story hadn&rsquo;t cheated me at all. I just hadn&rsquo;t been paying attention.</p><p>Part of the brilliance of <em>Lonesome Dove</em> lies in the subtlety with which it introduces violence. We begin the story, as I said before, in the arms of comfort. Lonesome Dove is a peaceful place. A bit boring maybe, and a little sad, but it&rsquo;s home. It&rsquo;s a safe place. But then we leave home, and it isn&rsquo;t long before danger rears its head. At first it&rsquo;s a fun kind of danger. It&rsquo;s stealing horses from rancher-tyrants and it&rsquo;s watching Glenne Headly watch men murder each other over her. It might not always be pleasant, especially that last example, but it&rsquo;s the kind of danger and violence that fits with the world we&rsquo;ve been introduced to. It&rsquo;s the kind of thing we expect, so much so that we&rsquo;d actually be disappointed if it wasn&rsquo;t there. And then, at end of the first episode, <em>Lonesome Dove</em> delivers its first real blow. Sean, an Irish immigrant who falls in with the heroes early on, has the misfortune to walk his horse through a river infested by water moccasins (that&rsquo;s another name for cottonmouth snakes). It&rsquo;s a shocking scene in itself, but it&rsquo;s still fair play. It&rsquo;s the most horrific scene we&rsquo;ve witnessed, but it&rsquo;s not so far outside the scope of what we&rsquo;ve come to expect that we feel cheated.</p><p>You see what the show&rsquo;s doing. Each act of violence is grislier than the last. In one scene Gus comes under fire from Blue Duck&rsquo;s men on an open plain and stabs his own horse to death so he can use it as cover. In another, an enslaved woman named Janey breaks the knees of her captor with a frying pan. By the end of the second episode, when Blue Duck kills Bryan, we&rsquo;re well within the type of world where kids get stabbed to death.</p><p>And yet, Bryan&rsquo;s death shocked me. And yet, I felt betrayed. And yet, if I felt that way, it was only because I&rsquo;d become complacent. I&rsquo;d unwittingly failed to take <em>Lonesome Dove</em> seriously, even though it had never once hidden its face from me, but revealed itself at a measured pace. It did its job, and it did it well. It&rsquo;s not the story&rsquo;s fault I thought we were still on the ranch.</p></article><article><header class=header-page><time class=date datetime=2023-12-05T10:00:46-06:00>December 05, 2023</time><h2 class=h1><a href=/posts/care-dammit/>And God Said, "Care, Dammit"</a></h2><div class=deck>Talmudic wisdom in 'The Exorcist.'</div><div class=container-meta><ul class=list-meta><li>#<a href=/tags/books/>books</a></li><li>#<a href=/tags/horror/>horror</a></li><li>#<a href=/tags/judaism/>judaism</a></li></ul></div></header><p>I was working on a short story about an exorcist (which I&rsquo;ve since abandoned) so I decided to read <em>The Exorcist.</em> I&rsquo;ve seen the movie but can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m a fan. The book is excellent. One passage stood out. It&rsquo;s said by Merrin, the senior exorcist, to Damien, the amateur who&rsquo;s been having a crisis of faith:</p><blockquote><p><em>Long ago I despaired of ever loving my neighbor. Certain people repelled me. How could I love them? I thought. It tormented me. It led me to despair of myself, and from that, very soon, to despair of my own God. My faith was shattered. But at last I realized that God would never ask of me that which I know to be psychologically impossible; that the love which He asked was in my</em> will <em>and not meant to be felt as emotion at all. He was asking that I</em> act <em>with love; that I</em> do <em>unto others; and that I should do it unto those who repelled me, I believe, was a greater act of love than any other.</em></p></blockquote><p>The priests in <em>The Exorcists</em> are Jesuits, but this passage struck me as Talmudic. In Judaism, you aren&rsquo;t asked to care. You&rsquo;re commanded to. And if you can&rsquo;t bring yourself to care, that does not relieve you of the obligation to act as though you do.</p><p>In turn, this reminds me of a sentiment I&rsquo;ve heard expressed by <a href=https://waitbutwhy.com/>Tim Urban</a> and <a href=https://www.astralcodexten.com/>Scott Alexander</a>, among others: You only get to call yourself principled if you apply your principles to people you can&rsquo;t stand.</p><p>In other words, kindness counts when it&rsquo;s easy, but it counts more, maybe much more, when it&rsquo;s hard.</p></article><a class=link-more href=/posts/>More >></a></main><footer id=footer-main>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a> and <a href=https://seldstein.github.io/elementary-theme-demo/>Elementary</a>.</footer></body></html>
