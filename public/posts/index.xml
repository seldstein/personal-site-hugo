      <description>Early October I went to South Dakota for the first time since I was a kid. I have a friend from college whose parents own a cabin in the Black Hills which she and her boyfriend (also a college friend) go to a few times a year, and I’d been talking about going with them for some time. I landed in Sioux Falls. My friends were driving from Des Moines, so it worked out that they could pick me up from the airport and we set out from there.</description>

      <description>Sam Spade exhibits a degree of unhinged lunacy on par with Hamlet, and there’s something to that, isn’t there, because you know what they have in common? They’re both damaged goods. Hamlet’s uncle killed his father and then had shameless carnal relations with his mother. It’s enough to drive anyone to San Francisco, and Sam, well we don’t know what he’s been through but part of the art of filmmaking as John Huston so deftly demonstrates is knowing what to say and when to say it, yes, but also knowing what not to say.</description>

      <description>Perhaps it’s her eyes, or how her expression always bespeaks the shadow of a smile, even when she’s crying, but we warm to Princess Ann straightaway. Of course it helps that she’s young and Audrey Hepburn, but really it has to do with the way we meet her; in the midst of a lengthy and exhausting royal public relations tour of Europe. By the time she finally finishes shaking the hands of an endless entourage of aristocrats and (one presumes) eligible bachelors, she has us completely.</description>

      <description>All movies have to become real, on some level, in order to do their good work, and some of them can only achieve this by taking active steps to distance themselves from reality. All movies do this to some extent simply by appearing on a screen, but some of them, as with The Lighthouse, need a little more than that.
